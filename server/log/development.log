              - `Budget#transactions`, which did not exist
              - Looking up hash key `:transactions` or `"transactions"` on `#<Budget:0x00000001121f6540>`, but it wasn't a Hash

              To implement this field, define one of the methods above (and check for typos), or supply a `fallback_value`.
