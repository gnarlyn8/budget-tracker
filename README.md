# CasaPay

A full-stack budget tracking application built with Rails GraphQL API and React TypeScript frontend.

## Architecture

This project consists of two main components:

- **Server**: Rails 8.0.2 API with GraphQL backend
- **Web**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite frontend

## Tech Stack

### Backend

- Ruby on Rails 8.0.2
- GraphQL API
- SQLite database
- Puma web server

### Frontend

- React 19
- TypeScript
- Apollo Client for GraphQL
- Vite for build tooling
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- ESLint for code quality

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ruby 3.2+
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the server directory:

   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. Install Ruby dependencies:

   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

3. Set up the database:

   ```bash
   rails db:create
   rails db:migrate
   ```

4. Start the Rails server:

The GraphQL endpoint will be available at `http://localhost:3000/graphql`

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the web directory:

   ```bash
   cd web
   ```

2. Install Node.js dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## Development

### Running Tests

- Backend: `cd server && rails test`
- Frontend: `cd web && npm run lint`

### Getting Started

4. **Set up budget categories** - Create categories for non-loan expenses (groceries, utilities, etc.)

### Managing Your Budget

- **Loan Accounts**: Track individual loans and their repayments
- **Budget Categories**: Organize other expenses that aren't loan-related
- **Transactions**: Add income and expenses that affect your accounts

### Key Features

- **Edit and delete** all accounts, transactions, and budget categories
- **Track spending** across different categories
- **Monitor loan repayments** separately from other expenses
- **Real-time updates** as you add or modify transactions

### Workflow

1. Add your monthly income to your budget account
2. Create loan accounts for each debt you're tracking
3. Set up budget categories for regular expenses
4. Record transactions as they occur
5. Monitor your spending and loan repayment progress
